1. setup file architecture, delete/add neccessary initial files.
2. using components/pages & functional components, create entire front end. (6 pages: home, profile, search char/comic, write/view reviews).
3. npm install react-router-dom and set up url params using element to render imported pages.
4. npm install firebase and set up firebase config file. Watch pedrotech on youtube for auth and db.

BONUS: maybe add global view reviews and you can see either recent or top 5 most liked reviews. maybe idk
BONUS: make sure to add api pics like polaroids same as og site on profile page. Maybe do for all cards
